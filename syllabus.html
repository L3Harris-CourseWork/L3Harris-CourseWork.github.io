<h1>Foundations of Software Engineering</h1>



<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course serves as an initiation into the field of Software Engineering, aiming to acquaint students with fundamental software engineering concepts and enabling them to apply this knowledge through a semester-long collaborative project.</p>


<h2>Course Topics</h2>
<p>The course will discuss software engineering in four broad areas of a software engineer's daily practice</p>

<ul>
	<li>Software design</li>
	<li>Quality assurance</li>
	<li>Communication</li>
	<li>Elements of Successful Software Projects</li>
	<li>Teamwork and Managing People</li>
	<li>Risk Management</li>
	<li>Plan-Driven and Agile Process Methodologies</li>
	<li>Process: Selecting, Tailoring, Assessing</li>
	<li>Planning (Estimating, Scheduling, Tracking)</li>
	<li>Object-Oriented Design</li>
</ul>



<h2>Course Objectives</h2>

<p>This course aims to equip students with both individual and collaborative software engineering competencies. Individual skills will encompass fundamental object-oriented design concepts and principles applicable to various classes and application subsystems. In the context of software development teams, you'll gain an understanding of the advantages of adhering to a structured process and adopting practices that promote high product quality. Teamwork will be a pivotal focus, with students honing their abilities through project-related activities. These teamwork abilities will encompass the efficient management of team meetings, task allocation, coordination of activities, and resolution of team-related issues. Additionally, you'll acquire communication skills spanning code and design documentation as well as delivering oral presentations on your project work. Project teams will leverage contemporary development techniques and tools as they engage in their project tasks.</p>


<h2>Individual Exercises</h2>
<p>Throughout the semester, several exercises will be conducted to reinforce the concepts covered in the course and to support the teams in their project work. Some exercises will also be conducted to introduce the tools and techniques employed in the team's product development process. Many of these exercises will require submissions, with the submission method depending on the nature of the activity—individual, team-based, or group-oriented for certain tasks.</p>
