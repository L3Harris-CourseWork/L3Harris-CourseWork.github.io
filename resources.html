<h1>Course Resources</h1>
<p>This page contains resources that you may use throughout the course, typically for the project component.</p>

<h2>API Resources</h2>
<p>Several API resources are provided to get you started. These simple examples are intended to get you started for your project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>API Examples: <a href="https://l3harriscourseexamples.onrender.com">Running</a> | <a href="https://github.com/L3Harris-CourseWork/CourseExamples">Source Code</a></li>

</ul>


<h2>Exam Study Guides</h2>

<p>You may use these guides to help you study for the exam. While there is no replacement for reviewing course materials and performing the expected readings, these study guides are a highly recommended starting point.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exam 1 Study Guide: <a href="resources/exams/studyguides/Exam1StudyGuide-NoAnswers.pdf">Study Guide</a> | <a href="resources/exams/studyguides/Exam1StudyGuide-Answers.pdf">Key</a></li>
  <li>Exam 2 Study Guide: <a href="resources/exams/studyguides/Exam2StudyGuide-NoAnswers.pdf">Study Guide</a> | <a href="resources/exams/studyguides/Exam2StudyGuide-Answers.pdf">Key</a></li>

</ul>




<h2>Technical Resources</h2>
<p></p>


<h3>Unit Testing</h3>
<p>Software development projects involve testing at various stages, with software developers taking responsibility for unit testing at the class level. When code is written within a class, developers are tasked with creating unit tests to validate code functionality for both normal and error scenarios. These tests should be executed using a testing framework like JUnit, which facilitates test execution and result verification. To ensure thorough testing, each class should be tested in isolation, necessitating the control of all dependencies the tested class relies on with other objects. Object mocking is a technique used to create objects that the tested class utilizes during testing. Mocking frameworks, such as Mockito, aid in defining mock objects and their expected behaviors when methods are called. Additionally, these frameworks enable tests to verify if methods were called the expected number of times during testing. Your team will be expected to develop unit tests for all non-trivial classes within your project.</p>


<p>The Unit testing technology that you select will obviously be highly dependent on the technology that you choose to implement your project with. However, be sure that the unit testing technology will properly integrate with GitHub and the hosting platform Render. You should additionally feel free to search for other possible unit testing technologies as you desire as there are many that are not encapsulated in this list.</p>

<h3>GitHub Tools</h3>
<p>Your team will be using GitHub as your version control repository. There are a wide range of techniques and tools for working with GitHub. There are tools with robust GUIs, or you may choose to use a simple command line interface. While the tool you use to integrate with GitHub is your decision, it is VERY HIGHLY recommended that you DO NOT only interact with GitHub through their web interface. This will prove to be cumbersome and fraught with challenges.</p>
