<h1>Project Support Activities</h1>

<p>There are several technologies that you will utilize for this project. These technologies also serve as the basis for understanding foundational software engineering concepts such as version control, unit testing and API usage.</p>



<h2><a name="A1"></a>Trello</h2>
<p>
Project management is a crucial component of any project, including software engineering projects. Trello is a simple and popular software engineering project management tool that you will utilize for this project throughout the semester.</p>


<h4>Activity</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Your team should create a simple Trello board that you will utilize for your project. You can follow this <a href="https://trello.com/guide" target="_blank">Trello</a> tutorial. However, there are many other Trello tutorials that you can follow on the web.</li>
	<li>You should include several foundational initial project-related activities on this board.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deliverable</h4>
Provide the link to your team’s Trello board to the designated submission area in Mycourses. Note, that you should submit <a href="project/projectfiles/L3Harris-ProjectSupportDocuments.docx">this</a> template (you can leave the a spects of the template that have not yet been covered blank for now).

</p>



<h2><a name="A2"></a>Github/Github Issues</h2>
<p>You will conduct a short hello world activity using Github. Understanding Git/Github is not only important for this project, but is important for understanding the benefits and usage of version control systems throughout the software engineering process. Additionally, Github issues is similarly a beneficial tool to know regarding bug tracking. </p>

<h4>Activity</h4>
You will conduct several activities for this task:

<ul>
	<li>You should create an individual Github repository and use <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world" target="=_blank">this</a> tutorial. Note, that there are many high-quality Github tutorials available that you should feel free to reference.</li>
	<li>Your team should create a single Github repository. One team member should create a simple text file containing their name. Each team member should "pull" this file, add their name and submit it to the central repository. Ultimately, each team member should have a checkin and the file should contain everyone's names. Additionally, to better understand the activity, your team is encouraged to create and mitigate <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github" target="_blank">merge conflicts.</a></li>
	<li>Complete the tutorial for <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart" target="_blank">Github issues</a>. Create several known and/or test defects in your application.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Deliverable</h4>
<p>Provide the link to your team’s GitHub repository to the designated submission area in Mycourses. Note, that you should submit <a href="project/projectfiles/L3Harris-ProjectSupportDocuments.docx">this</a> template (you can leave the aspects of the template that have not yet been covered blank for now).</p>




<h2><a name="A3"></a>Render</h2>
<p>While there are numerous possible hosting platforms, your team will utilize Render for several reasons. Some of which include being freely available, reasonably easy to use, existing integrations into Github and existing support documentation.</p>


<h4>Activity</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Each member of the team should complete the <a href="https://render.com/docs" target="_blank">Render</a> tutorial.</li>
	<li>Note: You may find this tutorial on <a href="https://www.back4app.com/docs-containers/how-to-create-a-dockerfile" target="_blank">Creating a docker file</a> helpful.</li>
	<li>Your team should develop a Render project that everyone has access to. </li>
	<ul>
		<li>The page should represent a single hello world application. </li>
		<li>The application should automatically be deployed by "pushing" the code to your team’s Github repository. This means that you will need to follow the <a href="https://render.com/docs/github" target="_blank">Render steps</a> for integrating Github into your project. You should use the Github repository that your team created for the previous submission.</li>
		<li>A stretch goal is to deploy your team’s technology stack to the platform. For example, create a hosted “Hello World” page using the language that your team will utilize.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Deliverable</h4>
<p>Provide the link to your team’s GitHub repository to the designated submission area in Mycourses. Note, that you should submit <a href="project/projectfiles/L3Harris-ProjectSupportDocuments.docx">this</a> template (you can leave the aspects of the template that have not yet been covered blank for now).</p>


<h2><a name="A4"></a>Coding Language Activity</h2>
<p>While there is no prescribed development language for your project, your team is required to utilize a technology stack that is <a href="https://render.com/docs/language-support" target="_blank">supported</a> by Render. You are encouraged to discuss potential technologies selected with your instructor.</p>

<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Using your team’s selected language, create a simple “Hello World” application that is hosted on your Render application. You should utilize one of the many tutorials available on Render for your specific language.</p>

<h4>Deliverable</h4>
<p>Provide the link to your team’s "Render" page to the designated submission area in Mycourses. This page should contain the implementation of the simple “Hello World”. Note, that you should submit <a href="project/projectfiles/L3Harris-ProjectSupportDocuments.docx">this</a> template (you can leave the aspects of the template that have not yet been covered blank for now).</p>


<h2><a name="A5"></a>Unit Testing</h2></h2>
<p>Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure they function as intended. A "unit" in this context is the smallest testable part of the software, typically a single function, method, or procedure. The primary goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed, helping to identify and fix bugs early in the development process. You will utilize it for your project. The specific form of unit testing that you use will be based upon your selected language.</p>


<h4>Activity</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Identify a proper unit testing technology for your selected language. For example, you can use this tutorial for <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-3.1.0/libdoc/test-unit/rdoc/Test/Unit.html" target="_blank">Ruby Unit Testing</a>.</li>
	<li>Create five “hello world” unit tests and integrate them into your platform.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Deliverable</h4>
<p>Provide the link to your team’s GitHub repository containing the clearly marked Unit Testing capabilities to the designated submission area in Mycourses. You should also submit a screenshot of the passing unit tests provided from Render. Note, that you should submit <a href="project/projectfiles/L3Harris-ProjectSupportDocuments.docx">this</a> template. Each component of the template should now be complete.</p>



<h2><a name="A6"></a>API Tech stack</h2>
<p>APIs serve as the foundation for numerous software projects ranging from enterprise-level applications to the apps used on your phone. You will utilize and create several APIs for our class project</p>

<h4>Activity</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Utilize at least two of the <a href="https://github.com/L3Harris-CourseWork/CourseExamples" target="_blank">instructor's provided example APIs</a> and read from them in your selected technology. The pages deployed on Render may be simple in appearance.</li>
	<li>Develop several unit tests to verify and validate these APIs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deliverable</h4>
<p>Deploy your code to your Render project. Submit the accessible link to Mycourses. Note that you will need to submit a .txt file with the link since you must submit a file to Mycourses. </p>
